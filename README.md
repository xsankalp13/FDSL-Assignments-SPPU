The codes in the repository is just for taking refrences, please do not copy entire code. see and just take hints

1. In second year computer engineering class, group A student’s play cricket, group B students
play badminton and group C students play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
    a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
    b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
    c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
    d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET builtin functions)


2. Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by
N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
    a) The average score of class
    b) Highest score and lowest score of class
    c) Count of students who were absent for the test
    d) Display mark with highest frequency

3. Write a Python program for department library which has N books, write functions for
following:
    a) Delete the duplicate entries
    b) Display books in ascending order based on cost of books
    c) Count number of books with cost more than 500.
    d) Copy books in a new list which has cost less than 500.

4. Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction
log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 100 W 200
(Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and
deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
    D 300, D 300 , W 200, D 100 Then, the output should be: 500
